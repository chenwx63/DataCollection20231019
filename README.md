This directory is designated for storing the raw data and corresponding results of the paper titled "Gain Factors Analysis of 5G-Assisted BeiDou RTK Positioning in Urban Environments". It comprises three folders: "simulation" which contains the GNSS data used in section5; "data" which contains the raw observation data in section 6, and "result" which contains the corresponding experimental results. The description of the corresponding files is provided in the following table.
